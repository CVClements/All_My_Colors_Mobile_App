     What do you do when your child has big feelings and doesn't know how to explain?

    Let colors talk for them! Colors have natural meaning to kids.
    
    Using the  All My Colors mobile app, your child can choose a bubble of color that shows their mood. If they feel like it, they can add a note as well. You can encourage your child's emotional awareness with this simple color diary.
    
    Start a conversation with color.</p>
