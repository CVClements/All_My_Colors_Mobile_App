    Dear Parent,
    <br><br>
     What do you do when your child has big feelings and doesn't know how to explain?
    <br>
    <br>
    Let colors talk for them! Colors have natural meaning to kids.
    <br><br>
    Using the  All My Colors mobile app, your child can choose a bubble of color that shows their mood. If they feel like it, they can add a note as well. You can encourage your child's emotional awareness with this simple color diary.
